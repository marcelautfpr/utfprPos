The materials related to the research will be given initially by the acquisition of the images, which will be acquired through the differential coloring method. For software development, the C ++ programming language will be used, using the Open Computer Vision (\sigla{Opencv}{Open Computer Vision }) version 3.1 library, which has implementations of algorithms for digital image processing and computational vision, together with the Qt development environment in Its opensource version, which facilitates the development of software with a graphical interface, facilitating its use by the user.

It will be used the similarity and dissimilarities method, which appropriates the concept of distances, Euclidian, Manhattan, Mahalanobis, Simple Wedding Coefficient and Jaccard Coefficient. Thus, measures of dissimilarity similarity allow the classification of the karyotype by their proximity or not of each other \cite{Genomika2015}.
