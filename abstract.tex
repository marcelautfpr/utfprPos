For what a food be considered functional is required certify that they have a certain amount of micro-organism. This quantity is determined in the laboratory by plating containing the micro-organism in question and after a period of incubation is performed manually counting the number of bacterial colonies which are present on each plate. In this way this study aims to develop a software that be able to perform the counting of these colonies contained in petri dishes in an automated fashion. For such an algorithm was developed based on digital image processing techniques what be able to identify the petri dish within the image and thus make the count of the number of colonies present on each plate. For this algorithm was developed, was essential develop a standardization of image acquisition. From the specific hardware development and acquisition gives images, software execution, the results were compared taking the manual count as a parameter. As a result highlights is a globe correlation 0.948 compared to manual counting and a correlation of 0.8134 on a more individual analysis, thus it can be concluded based on the results obtained, as initial design study is satisfactory, it is however recommended continuation do study.
