It is expected that at the end of the whole process, the developed software will be able to identify which fish species belongs to this karyotype in the image. However, given the characteristic of the problem, it is known from the outset that it is not possible to obtain 100\% recognition of the test base, however, efforts will be devoted to identifying positively the closest of the totality. In this way, it is expected that such research will produce significant results, increasing interest in the topic addressed by this study, and encouraging further work, this time more comprehensive, to be developed
